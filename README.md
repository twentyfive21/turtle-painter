# Interesting piece of code :

## I found this piece of code interesting because I got to use instance of more and also down casting which is something I have been wanting to work with. I also had to read the csv in a new way since headlines did not hold any data so that challeneged me how to access the line I wanted only. It took me a few rounds of testing to see what wokred best and I am happy with what I came up with! It was a good learning lesson and I was happy how I implemented it!
